Whether it is the list of Pakistan’s most backward districts, poverty rates and GDP per capita, or unemployment, illiteracy and lack of connectivity, Balochistan ranks at the bottom of the pyramid. There are, of course, inbuilt structural impediments such as a large area, sparse population, low density, tracts of uncultivable and rugged land, dwindling water availability, long distances between few urban areas. Cost of building infrastructure is relatively higher than in other parts of the country and that is why greater allocation to Balochistan under the NFC award is fully justified. However, there are issues of strategic choices, resource utilisation, public investment and development priorities that are amenable to prudent management.

After all, for the last seven months we have heard him say confidently that he would win back the Washington-based lender and secure a new, concessionary deal to match the government’s growth objectives. True, a few concessions have been secured here and there, but the conditions that he revealed on Tuesday leave little room for optimism: the IMF wants Islamabad to implement prior actions for the reinstatement of the programme. Mr Tarin and the government will now be implementing everything they had refused to in April thinking they could pursue their procyclical policies to push economic growth to improve the ruling party’s electoral prospects in 2023. That the IMF had no intention of softening its conditions was obvious from day one, despite Mr Tarin’s insistence that once the government had demonstrated the viability of its growth policies the Fund would let it have its way. The government also thought the US exit from Afghanistan would increase its leverage on the Biden administration. That gamble too hasn’t paid off.

But in the larger perspective, small steps can go a long way in easing the complex Pakistan-India relations. Analysts have often noted that if positive action is taken on ‘soft’ issues, the trickier challenges that have plagued relations in the subcontinent may also be ripe for resolution. The recent release of Indian fishermen prisoners by Pakistan qualifies as one such step. Religious visits also fall within the category of doable ‘soft’ solutions, and proponents of peace on both sides have long been saying that pilgrimages to sacred sites in India and Pakistan should be facilitated. In this regard, the reopening of the Kartarpur corridor is a welcome sign. The gurdwara — sacred to Sikhs for its connection to their religion’s founder Guru Nanak — located in Pakistan was renovated and opened with much fanfare in 2019. The move was appreciated by Sikhs across the world, including in India, and the opening ceremony was attended by Prime Minister Imran Khan as well as former Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh. However, the visa-free corridor facility was closed last year due to Covid-19. Now, with the reopening announced by the Indian side, it is hoped that Sikh pilgrims are allowed to visit the sacred site freely.",Reopening Kartarpur,Published,"18 Nov, 2021 07:06am","18 Nov, 2021",welcome in my world

That is worrisome since local governments are the main building blocks of strong democracies and good governance. Strip away the rhetoric and one finds Pakistani politicians least interested in grassroots democracy because of their strong aversion to sharing power and resources with local public representatives. Unless compelled to establish local governments, politicians would do anything to undermine the lower levels of democracy. Even when they agree to hold elections, they are reluctant to devolve administrative and financial authority. Now the ECP has put the Sindh government on notice. It has given the PPP two weeks to share with the ECP maps and other relevant data for carrying out delimitations in order to hold long overdue local polls in the province.
