Other than the fact that they begin with the letter ‘P’, both are capable of issuing statements from time to time which no one takes seriously. And both are toothless. The PEC is supposed to safeguard the rights of engineering firms and engineers in the country but it has sadly failed to do so as it is not backed up by any political will or government support. Recently, prominently placed appeals by the Contractors Association of Pakistan to the prime minister and planning minister were published by newspapers. These appeals were alerting those in power to the imminent collapse of the construction/ engineering sector. The publication of such appeals indicates how toothless the PEC is that despite having a PTI parliamentarian as the recently elected chairman, the matter could not be brought to the notice of those in authority via any official forum.",Sitting ducks,Published,"16 Nov, 2021 07:01am","16 Nov, 2021",welcome in my world

That is worrisome since local governments are the main building blocks of strong democracies and good governance. Strip away the rhetoric and one finds Pakistani politicians least interested in grassroots democracy because of their strong aversion to sharing power and resources with local public representatives. Unless compelled to establish local governments, politicians would do anything to undermine the lower levels of democracy. Even when they agree to hold elections, they are reluctant to devolve administrative and financial authority. Now the ECP has put the Sindh government on notice. It has given the PPP two weeks to share with the ECP maps and other relevant data for carrying out delimitations in order to hold long overdue local polls in the province.

In order to address this gap, the government last year launched a subsidised housing finance scheme under which banks have been directed by the State Bank to lend up to Rs10m to first-time homeowners. The banks have also been asked to increase their lending for the housing and construction sectors to at least 5pc of their total private sector advances by December 2021. A part of their monthly housing finance disbursements, however, must include ‘small-ticket’ loans for aspiring homeowners with monthly income as low as Rs25,000 for the construction or purchase of low-cost homes under the Mera Pakistan Mera Ghar initiative. In order to ensure the success of the scheme, the central bank assigns the banks every month rolling housing finance targets according to the size of their private sector credit portfolios. The failure to meet these targets attracts punitive action from the State Bank. Yet, lending for low-cost housing is painfully slow.

The showdown between Australia and New Zealand felt well and truly over at the toss. Teams batting second had won night matches of the World Cup at the Dubai International Stadium and after Australian captain Aaron Finch put New Zealand in to bat, Kane Willamson’s side faced an uphill struggle. Both sides were chasing their maiden T20 title, Australia looking to add it to their five ODI World Cups and New Zealand seeking a first-ever limited-overs crown. Williamson’s brilliant 85 had steered his side to 172 but Australia had already shown that a target under 180 was well within their reach, having foiled Pakistan in the semi-finals. New Zealand did rock them early but Mitchell Marsh and player of the tournament David Warner led the Australian charge to victory. Having come into the tournament as underdogs, Australia once again proved they remain world cricket’s top side. For New Zealand, it was another limited-overs heartbreak, having lost the title matches at both the 2015 and 2019 ODI World Cups although their victory in the inaugural Test Championship this year shows they remain the world’s best cross-format team.",Rejigging T20 finals stage,Published,"16 Nov, 2021 06:58am","16 Nov, 2021",welcome in my world
